Provides:
* DNS servers (global)
* DNS search domains (per-user is WIP)
* version specific route limits on older clients
* dynamic calculation of user-specific routes based on their IAM ACLs.
* classic static route lines
* protocol-specific lines as needed.

Clients older than 2.4 are not supported.
